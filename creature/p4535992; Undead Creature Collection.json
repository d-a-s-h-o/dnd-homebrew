The skeleton lord can also animate the skeletons of the slain themselves, and those who find themselves fighting a skeleton lord often find themselves fighting a horde of smaller skeletons as well.<br><br><b>Blind Anger. </b><br>A skeleton lord doesn't distinguish between good and evil; it simply takes out the slain's collective anger on whatever happens to come nearby. This anger won't be abated even if the perpetrators of the murders are killed; unless they are stopped, skeleton lords will continue killing forever.<br><br><b>Deadly Guardians.</b> <br>Because skeleton lords do not stray far from the location of the slaughter that spawned them, they are occasionally created by those who would use them to guard a particularly powerful secret or treasure. By killing a large group of people and then fleeing the scene before the skeleton lord can arise, a person can create a powerful guard at very little risk to themselves.<br><br></p>"
